# 2D-random-map-generator
This is a random 2D map generator I used for generating a very basic map 2d map for my thesis website. This is pretty handy for mocking a basic 2d map.


*Usage:*
Clone this repository. Within the folder, execute "Windows.exe". Given a random seed, number of houses, trees etc, and a number of mapping choices a very basic random 2d map can be generated.
